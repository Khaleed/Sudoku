# sudoku
This project is a Java-based Sudoku game with a graphical user interface created using JavaFX. 

The UserInterfaceImpl class creates and manages the graphical user interface, including a 9x9 grid of text fields and styling for the window and board. It also handles user input events and updates the game board with the current game state and values. 

The game logic works by responding to user input to update the game's UI and back-end. This is handled by the ControlLogic class. The game data is also stored on local file storage.
